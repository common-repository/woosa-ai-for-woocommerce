1. Replace all occurences of `_wsa_namespace_` with your unique namespace
2. Replace all occurences of `_wsa_js_prefix_` and `_wsa_css_prefix_` with your prefix string
3. Replace all occurences of `_wsa_text_domain_` with your translation text-domain
4. If you're using composer, make sure you instruct composer to load the files. In case you do not use composer then you have to include them manually
